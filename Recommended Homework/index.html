            <h3 class="background_title teal">Background</h3>
              <p>I was born and raised in a rather lousy part of Staten Island, New York. While my family never had the means to provide me with Air Max 95's
              or Nautica jeans growing up, I believe my humble background shaped many of the qualities I am proudest of as the person I am today.</p>
              <p>In my late teens/early twenties, I bounced around in the retail circuit for a few years, but personal computing was always my full time hobby. Whether I was tinkering
              with eggdrop bots on IRC, trying to get +v in #Razor1911 or learning network security as a script kiddy and <a href="http://attrition.org/mirror/attrition/l7.html">defacing the Chinese US Embassy website,</a> I've always had a passion for computers. 
              <p>I also own and operate an award winning limousine service in Red Bank, NJ called <a href="www.redbanklimo.com">Red Bank Limo</a> that generates $1m/year in annual revenue.</p>
